# Pacman Invalid Packages

## Problem
When trying to upgrade the system or a specific package, an error occurs that says the package is damaged or the "signature is of marginal trust".

## How to fix
The solution is described in the 
[Endeavouros Wiki](https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/issues-with-signature-is-marginal-trust-signature-is-unknown-trust-or-invalid-or-corrupted-package/6756)
and was in my last case because the system clock was not set correctly.

Fix was simply to change the Date&Time setting to "Set date and time automatically".
